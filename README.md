stm32f4 discovery SPI accelerometer example

Simple implementation of accessing LIS3DSH accelerometer on STM32F4 Discovery board using SPI interface. Four LEDs present on the board lit up when board is tilted in their direction. In case of error all LEDs light up.

To set clock set appropriate constants in MAIN.H , default is 168MHz.
